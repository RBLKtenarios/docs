# 🌍 How to Make Your Java Minecraft Server Cross-Compatible with Bedrock Using Geyser and Floodgate (2025)

Looking to let your **Bedrock Edition players** join your **Java Edition Minecraft server**? Whether you're a server owner or a hosting provider, enabling **crossplay support** using **GeyserMC** and **Floodgate** is the most reliable solution in 2025.

This guide will walk you through the full process of installing and configuring Geyser and Floodgate plugins, allowing players from consoles, mobile, and Windows 10 to seamlessly connect to your Java server.

---

## ✅ What You'll Need

Before we start, here are the requirements:

- A running **Java Minecraft server** (Paper, Spigot, or Velocity)
- Access to your server’s **plugins folder** and **console**
- **Java 17+** (for latest Geyser builds)
- Internet access (for downloading plugins)
- Optional: Pterodactyl panel or hosting control panel access

---

## 🔌 Step 1: Download GeyserMC Plugin

> Geyser acts as a proxy between Minecraft: Bedrock Edition and Minecraft: Java Edition.

1. Go to the official [Geyser Downloads page](https://geysermc.org/download/).
2. Select your server type (e.g., **Spigot**, **Paper**, or **Velocity**).
3. Download the latest stable `.jar` file.
4. Upload it to your server’s `plugins` folder.

📦 Example for Paper:
```bash
/plugins/Geyser-Spigot.jar
```

---

## 🔒 Step 2: Download Floodgate (Optional but Recommended)

> Floodgate allows Bedrock players to join **without needing a Java account**.

1. Go to the [Floodgate Downloads page](https://geysermc.org/download/).
2. Download the matching **Floodgate plugin** for your server type.
3. Upload it to the `plugins` folder, alongside Geyser.

📦 Example:
```bash
/plugins/Floodgate-Spigot.jar
```

---

## 🔁 Step 3: Restart Your Server

Restart your server so Geyser and Floodgate can generate their configuration files.

```bash
stop
start
```

Or use your hosting panel’s restart button.

---

## ⚙️ Step 4: Configure Geyser

1. Navigate to:  
   ```
   /plugins/Geyser-Spigot/config.yml
   ```

2. Modify the following options:

```yaml
bedrock:
  port: 19132 # Default Bedrock port
  address: 0.0.0.0 # Allow all IPs to connect

remote:
  address: 127.0.0.1
  port: 25565 # Your Java server port
  auth-type: floodgate
```

🔐 If you're not using Floodgate, change `auth-type` to `online`.

---

## 🧾 Step 5: Open Firewall Port for Bedrock (UDP)

Ensure your hosting or VPS firewall allows **UDP traffic on port 19132**:

### For Linux (UFW):
```bash
sudo ufw allow 19132/udp
```

### For Hosting Panels:
- Go to your **network/firewall settings**
- Allow inbound **UDP** on port `19132`

---

## 🔎 Step 6: Test Bedrock Connection

Now, launch Minecraft on a Bedrock device (mobile, console, Windows 10) and:

1. Tap **Play** → **Servers** → **Add Server**
2. Use:
   - **IP Address**: Your server’s public IP
   - **Port**: `19132`

You should be able to join using a Bedrock account 🎮

---

## 🛠 Troubleshooting Tips

- **"Unable to connect to world"** – Make sure your server’s Bedrock port is open (UDP 19132).
- **"Java server not found"** – Check `remote.address` and ensure it's pointing to the Java server.
- **Floodgate not working?** – Ensure it's in the same plugin folder and not missing dependencies.

---

## 🌟 Why Use Geyser and Floodgate in 2025?

- ✅ Full crossplay support for mobile, console, and Windows 10
- ✅ No Java account needed with Floodgate
- ✅ Easy setup and active development
- ✅ Seamless integration with hosting panels like Pterodactyl
