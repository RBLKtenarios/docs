# 🧭 How to Change Your Minecraft Server Version

Whether you want to downgrade or update your Minecraft server, there are two main ways to switch your server version:

1. **Manual Upload** – You upload the server `.jar` file yourself  
2. **Hosting Panel Installer** – Use your host's built-in version selector or installer

## 📂 Method 1: Change Version by Uploading Server Jar (Manual)

### 🔧 Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Stop Your Server**  
   Always stop your server before making any changes to avoid file corruption.

2. **Delete/Backup Old Files**  
   - Backup your `world`, `plugins`, and `configs` if needed.
   - Delete the current `server.jar` or version-specific jar (like `paper-xxx.jar`).

3. **Download the Server Jar You Want**
   - Go to the official site:
     - Vanilla: [minecraft.net/download/server](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server)
     - Paper: [papermc.io](https://papermc.io/)
     - Spigot: Use [BuildTools](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/buildtools/)
     - Forge: [files.minecraftforge.net](https://files.minecraftforge.net/)
   - Download the desired `.jar` version to your computer.

4. **Upload the Jar to Your Server**
   - Use **SFTP** (like FileZilla) or your host’s file manager.
   - Upload the `.jar` to the root directory (usually where your `server.properties` is).

5. **Rename the Jar (If Needed)**
   - Rename it to `server.jar` or match what your host expects (e.g., `run.jar`).
   - Adjust your `startup command` in the panel if it's not `server.jar`.

6. **Start the Server**
   - Confirm everything loads correctly. Check the console logs for version confirmation.

## ⚙️ Method 2: Use Hosting Panel Installer

Many hosting providers (especially with Pterodactyl-based panels) offer one-click version switching.

### 📥 How to Use It:

1. **Go to the Version Installer Section**
   - Usually labeled something like “Minecraft Version”, “Installer”, or “Server Jar Manager”

2. **Choose Your Desired Version**
   - Options often include:
     - Vanilla
     - Paper
     - Spigot
     - Forge
     - Fabric
   - Select the version number (e.g., 1.20.6, 1.19.4, etc.)

3. **Click Install or Change**
   - The panel will automatically download the server jar.
   - Some hosts let you keep old worlds or reset everything — choose accordingly.

4. **Restart the Server**
   - The new version will now be active!

## 🧠 Final Tips

- **Check Plugin Compatibility** – Plugins may break when switching major versions.
- **Backups Are Crucial** – Always back up your `world` and configs before changing versions.
- **Match Clients** – Players must use the same version as your server.
