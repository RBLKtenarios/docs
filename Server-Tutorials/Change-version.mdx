## Why Change Minecraft Server Version?

Changing your server version can help you:

- Play on older versions like 1.12.2 or 1.8.9 for PvP

- Use modpacks that require Forge or Fabric

- Install plugins compatible with a specific version

- Improve server performance and stability

---

## Before You Begin

Before changing the version, make sure to:

- Backup your **world**, **plugins**, and **configs**

- Let your players know (downgrading may break saves)

- Check plugin/mod compatibility for your new version

## How to Change Server Version in Minecraft

### 1. Identify the Version You Want

Decide which version you need:

- **PvP** servers often use 1.8.9

- **Modded** servers use Forge or Fabric

- **Plugin** servers typically use Spigot or Paper

### 2. Download the Correct Server Jar

Download the `.jar` file for your desired server type and version:

| Server Type | Where to Download |

|-------------|-------------------|

| Vanilla     | [[minecraft.net](http://minecraft.net)](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server) |

| Spigot      | [BuildTools](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/buildtools/) |

| Paper       | [[papermc.io](http://papermc.io)](https://papermc.io/downloads) |

| Forge       | [[files.minecraftforge.net](http://files.minecraftforge.net)](https://files.minecraftforge.net/) |

| Fabric      | [[fabricmc.net](http://fabricmc.net)](https://fabricmc.net/use/) |

\> 🔒 **Tip**: Always download from official or trusted sources to avoid malware.

### 3. Replace Your Server Jar

1. Stop your server.

2. Delete or rename the old `server.jar`.

3. Upload your new `.jar` and name it `server.jar` (or configure startup script accordingly).

4. Start your server.

### 4. Update Server Configuration (Optional)

- \*`eula.txt`\*\*: Set `eula=true` if running for the first time

- \*`server.properties`\*\*: Adjust settings (like port, level name)

- **Mods/Plugins**: Update or replace to match the new version
