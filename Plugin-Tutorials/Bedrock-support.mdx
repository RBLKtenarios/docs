##  What You'll Need

Before we start, here are the requirements:

- A running **Java Minecraft server** (Paper, Spigot, or Velocity)
- Access to your serverâ€™s **plugins folder** and **console**
- **Java 17\+** (for latest Geyser builds)
- Internet access (for downloading plugins)
- Optional: Pterodactyl panel or hosting control panel access

## Step 1: Download GeyserMC Plugin

> Geyser acts as a proxy between Minecraft: Bedrock Edition and Minecraft: Java Edition.

1. Go to the official [Geyser Downloads page](https://geysermc.org/download/).
2. Select your server type (e.g., **Spigot**, **Paper**, or **Velocity**).
3. Download the latest stable `.jar` file.
4. Upload it to your serverâ€™s `plugins` folder.

Example for Paper:

```bash
/plugins/Geyser-Spigot.jar
```

## Step 2: Download Floodgate (Optional but Recommended)

> Floodgate allows Bedrock players to join **without needing a Java account**.

1. Go to the [Floodgate Downloads page](https://geysermc.org/download/).
2. Download the matching **Floodgate plugin** for your server type.
3. Upload it to the `plugins` folder, alongside Geyser.

Example:

```bash
/plugins/Floodgate-Spigot.jar
```

---

## Step 3: Restart Your Server

Restart your server so Geyser and Floodgate can generate their configuration files.

```bash
stop
start
```

Or use your hosting panelâ€™s restart button.

## \
 Step 4: Configure Geyser

1. Navigate to:

   ```
   /plugins/Geyser-Spigot/config.yml
   ```
2. Modify the following options:

```yaml
bedrock:
  port: 19132 # Default Bedrock port
  address: 0.0.0.0 # Allow all IPs to connect

remote:
  address: 127.0.0.1
  port: 25565 # Your Java server port
  auth-type: floodgate
```

 If you're not using Floodgate, change `auth-type` to `online`.

##  Step 5: Test Bedrock Connection

Now, launch Minecraft on a Bedrock device (mobile, console, Windows 10) and:

1. Tap **Play** â†’ **Servers** â†’ **Add Server**
2. Use:
   - **IP Address**: Your serverâ€™s public IP
   - **Port**: `19132` (Or the port you used earlier)

You should be able to join using a Bedrock account 

---

##  Troubleshooting Tips

- **"Unable to connect to world"** â€“ Make sure your serverâ€™s Bedrock port is open (UDP 19132).
- **"Java server not found"** â€“ Check `remote.address` and ensure it's pointing to the Java server.
- **Floodgate not working?** â€“ Ensure it's in the same plugin folder and not missing dependencies.
